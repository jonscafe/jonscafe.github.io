## What Time Is It? (Forensics, 911 Points)

> Super Secure Company’s database was recently breached. One of the employees self reported a potential phishing event that could be related. Unfortunately, our Linux email server does not report receiving any emails on March 2, 2023.
>
> Can you identify when this email was actually sent? The flag format is `utflag{MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM}` in UTC time.

The flag is just when the email was sent. There’s a `Date` header in the email, but it was too obvious (and wasn’t correct when I tried). After scanning the whole file, I figured the forensics trick was to reverse engineer some seemingly random text to determine when it was sent. There were only 2 pieces of information that fit into this category - the `Content-Type boundary`, and the `Message-ID` header.

Doing a quick Google Search, I found [this great article](https://www.metaspike.com/dates-gmail-message-id-thread-id-timestamps/) about hiding timestamps in Gmail Message IDs. However, after looking through other articles and rereading this one a few times, I realized it wouldn’t work. One line says:

```
Please note that the Gmail Message ID of a message is different than its Message-Id
header field which might look something like this:

Message-Id: <13eba327.EAAAAO8sA-QAAcgxWv4AAAd9o_wAAAAIijYAAAAAAAYklQBfFbYb@mailjet.com>
```

We had the Gmail message ID, which is different than the actual `Message-ID` header, which is why the decoding process didn’t work.

### Boundary Timestamp

Turning to the other piece of information, I found that [Part 2 in the series of the above article](https://www.metaspike.com/gmail-mime-boundary-delimiter-timestamps/) was actually about hidden timestamps in Gmail `Content-Type` boundaries. The decoding process was fairly easy.

```
Given --> 00000000000093882205f60cdcdb

1. Extract numbers:
    Part 1 --> 938822 (first 6 non-0 hex chars)
    Part 2 --> 05f60cdc (next 8 hex chars)

2. Append Part 1 to Part 2:
    05f60cdc938822

3. Convert to decimal
    0x05f60cdc938822 = 1677909984249890

4. Convert to timestamp (using epochconverter.com)
    1677909984249890 = Saturday, March 4, 2023 6:06:24.249 AM
```

**Flag:** `utflag{03/04/2023-06:06}`
